# Biom - React + Tailwind + Framer motion

React project which uses vite as a starter since CRA is deprecated. Used Tailwind for the styling and Framer motion as an animation library.

The project uses React version ^18.3.1.

The project uses Framer Motion version ^11.3.21.

The project uses Tailwind CSS version ^3.4.7.
Tailwind CSS is configured with PostCSS version ^8.4.40.
Autoprefixer, a PostCSS plugin, is used with version ^10.4.20.

Notes:
I started with the desktop version, translating the concept from Adobe XD into code. Once the barebones structure was complete, I began incorporating the necessary details such as styles and animations. Afterward, I adjusted the code for larger displays and finally optimized it for smaller screens, which included creating a custom menu and other features.

I enjoyed the project because it was diverse enough to test various skills and presented a fun challenge. The only issue I encountered was a personal one: I miscalculated the project's time estimation, as some areas took longer than expected.

In total, the project took me approximately 18-25 hours.

I deployed the app on Vercel at the following [Link](https://biom.trle.dev/), [Alternate Link](https://biom-liart.vercel.app/)
